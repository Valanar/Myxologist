## Database Update ##

> Store user data to save ingredients and favorite recipes

> allow for recipes to be upvoted, downvoted, and favorited

> store official recipes separate from user generated recipes

> build in an alert so when a user generated recipe has enough positive feedback it can be considered for adding to official, credited to the user

> Add a button allowing user generated recipes to be displayed if ingredients match

## Improved Mobile Functionality ##
